## ⚠️ Notice — About This Fork

This is a **temporary fork** of the original [MultiBot addon by Macx-Lio](https://github.com/Macx-Lio/MultiBot).

The reason for this fork is that I submitted several pull requests to the original repository, but since the creator, **Macx-Lio**, is currently unavailable, those changes could not be merged.

To allow the community to benefit from the additional features and improvements I have implemented, I’ve published this fork **as a temporary solution**.

As soon as the original author returns and is able to review and merge the contributions, this repository will be removed in favor of the official version.

> **All credit for the original addon goes to Macx-Lio.** I do not claim ownership of this project — I’m simply maintaining a working version until development resumes on the main repository.

Thank you for understanding.
